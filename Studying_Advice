		<p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</p>
		<p>Always study in the same place?</p>
		<p>Wrong!</p>
		<p>Study one topic intensively before going on to the next?</p>
		<p>Wrong!</p>
		<p>Here are some study tips based on actual research</p>
		<p>From Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits, by Benedict Carey, published in the New York Times on September 6, 2010.</p>
		<p>Alternative study environments</p>
		<p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ... Varying the place you study helps you remember more.</p>
		<p>Mix content</p>
		<p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember more.</p>
		<p> Space study sessions</p>
		<p>Thee one-hour sessions is more effective than one threee-hour session</p>
		<p>Self-testing</p>
		<p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p>
		<p>CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.</p>
