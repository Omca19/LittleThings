			<h1>Metaphor</h1>
		</header>
		
<section class = "pf">	
	<p>A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For<br> example moo is to cow as beep is to car. These mappings <br>get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their <br>effects.</p>
	<p>For example, take the language used to describe a debate:</p>
</section>

<section class = "fq">
	<p><q>He shot down her ideas.</q> 
	<p><q>She defended her position.</q></p>
	<p><q>She overwhelmed his arguements.</q></p>
	<p><q>He had to retreat from that position.</q></p>
</section>

<section class = "pf">
	<p>These are all debate-as-war metaphors. It's a zero sum game. <br>Someone wins and someone loses. The idea that both people <br>could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</p>
