		</header>
		
<section class = "pf">	
	<p>A metaphor is a mapping from one domain to another. For example moo is to cow as beep is to car. These mappings <br>get so buried in our language that we don't even notice their effects.</p>

</section>

<section class = "fq">
<!-- I put in the actual quotes instead of <q> cause they didn't look the way I wanted -->
	<p>"He shot down her ideas."</p>
	<p>"She defended her position."</p>
	<p>"She overwhelmed his arguments."</p>
	<p>"He had to retreat from that position."</p>
</section>

<section class = "pf">
	<p>These are all debate-as-war metaphors. It's a zero sum game. Someone wins and someone loses. The idea that both people could learn from each other just doesn't come up.</p>
