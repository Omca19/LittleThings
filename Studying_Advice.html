		<h2>Alternative study environments</h2>
		<p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ... Varying the place you study helps you remember more.</p>
		<h2>Mix content</h2>
		<p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember more.</p>
		<h2> Space study sessions</h2>
		<p>Thee one-hour sessions is more effective than one threee-hour session</p>
		<h2>Self-testing</h2>
		<p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p>
		<p>CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for.</p>
